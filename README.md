# Vier Gewinnt (Connect Four) Game

## Overview
This Java program implements a simplified version of the classic "Connect Four" game, known as "Vier Gewinnt" in German. The game is designed for two players who take turns dropping colored discs into a 6x7 grid, with the goal of connecting four discs of the same color in a row. Crafting this game was not only about creating entertainment but also seizing an opportunity to elevate my Java skills and revisit the fundamentals that form the backbone of my programming journey.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run the game.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VierGewinnt.git
   cd VierGewinnt
   javac VierGewinnt.java
   java VierGewinnt



## How to Play

    Players take turns entering the column where they want to drop their disc.
    The disc will fall to the lowest available position in the chosen column.
    The first player to connect four discs of their color in a row wins.
    The game ends in a draw if the entire grid is filled without a winner.
